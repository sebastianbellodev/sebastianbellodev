## 🚀 Hi!
I'm a software engineering student with a strong enthusiasm for problem-solving and creating efficient and scalable solutions. At the moment I'm leaning towards designing, building and testing distributed systems and microservices orchestration. Focused on pipelines, continuos integration (CI) and continuos delivery (CD), as well as DevOps practices.
