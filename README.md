## ðŸš€ Welcome to my coding space!
I'm pursuing a degree in software engineering and working on my paper about microservices testing. I'm getting started with React, but I'm also planning to learn Astro, Vue.js, Next.js, and Laravel. My interests are Software Architecture, Web Development, DevOps, Docker, Data Structures and AI (especially coding with Python).
